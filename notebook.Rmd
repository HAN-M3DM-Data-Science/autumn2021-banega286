## Business understanding

Breast cancer is the top cancer in women both in the developed and the developing world. In the Netherlands it is the most pervasive form of cancer (“WHO Cancer Country Profiles 2020” n.d.). In order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival early detection remains the most important instrument for breast cancer control. If machine learning could automate the identification of cancer, it would improve efficiency of the detection process and might also increase its effectiveness by providing greater detection accuracy.
